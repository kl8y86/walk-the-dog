#### Gamification is a new form of functional software that is not widely used by people on
  a daily basis, and its excellent communication and guidance are already commonly
  recognized in other areas. For functional software that emphasizes simplicity and ease
  of use, the acceptance of gamification is certainly an issue that needs to be addressed.
  In this article, we present gamification software in the form of a virtual pet, which is
  inherently designed to encourage users to use sustainable travel methods and to provide
  feedback and rewards. We invited a total of six members of another COMP2213
  coursework team to participate in the evaluation of our low-fidelity prototype following
  the focus group protocol. At the end of the process, we asked several questions related
  to usability and usefulness and the participants expressed positive feedback.
